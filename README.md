# Computer-aid-diagnostic-system-to-predict-and-extract-Lung-Cancer
Detecting lung cancer by building a neural network (CNN) that help to predict whether the image that been given to the network is normal or Abnormal.
Furthermore, extract the Abnormal tumor using image processing Technique (FCM segmentation).
However, other techniques have been used to help the process were (ccl algorithm) and image maskes (to clean the edge and unwanted parts from the thorax).
